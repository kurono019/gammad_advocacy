      <h2>What is Pollution?</h2>
      <p>

        water, and land the essential resources we rely on every day.

      <h2>My Advocacy</h2>
      <p>
        My advocacy focuses on spreading awareness about pollution and promoting
        eco-friendly actions. We believe that small changes like reducing plastic use,
        proper waste disposal, and planting trees can make a huge difference for
        future generations.
